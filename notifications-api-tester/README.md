# Genesys Cloud Demo
# Notifications API Tester (Implicit Grant)

To test Genesys Notifications APIs, you can use the official Genesys tool called "Developer Toolbox". However, it often requires multiple copy and paste actions. This tool allows you to test Notifications APIs easily in a single-page application.
Please note that this tool uses the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow for authentication, so make sure to open it in the same session where you are already signed in to Genesys Cloud.

**Initial implementation: February 2025*
