# Genesys Cloud Demo
## Real-time Keyword Detection

This solution allows you to detect conversations where a predefined keyword is spoken in real time. It covers all the voice conversations across your entire Genesys Cloud organization. Also, there is no need to open another application window if you implement it through [client application integration](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-custom-client-application-integrations/).

**Initial implementation: June 2025*
